/**
 * Sets Operations Module
 * This module can be extended for set operations in the calculator
 * Currently, set operations are complex and require array input
 * 
 * For future implementation:
 * - Set union: union([1,2,3], [2,3,4]) => [1,2,3,4]
 * - Set intersection: intersection([1,2,3], [2,3,4]) => [2,3]
 * - Set difference: difference([1,2,3], [2,3]) => [1]
 * 
 * Note: Set operations require special UI handling as they work with arrays
 * This file serves as a placeholder for future set operation features
 */

export class SetsModule {
    constructor() {
        // Reserved for future set operations implementation
    }
}

// This file is prepared for future expansion
// Set operations will require:
// 1. Array input handling in InputHandler
// 2. Set operation functions in ExpressionEvaluator
// 3. Special UI elements for set input
// 4. Set visualization capabilities
